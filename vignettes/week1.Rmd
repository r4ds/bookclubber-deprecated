##### THINGS TO COVER

Things to make sure you cover: 

1) Introduce yourself
2) Get everyone to introduce themselves, possibly with what they're hoping to learn from this book!
3) How frequently do you want to meet? (Once a week is nice because it provides some consistency)
5) Set some expectations

##### Optional
